            <p>Who Am I?</p>
            <p>My name is Steven Benz and I'm a former Marine with a passion for anything tech related. Currently I'm a student majoring in Computer Networking with a GPA of 3.8. I'm dedicated, hardworking, and willing to learn. I started learning HTML5 and CSS3 on my own for about a year now. I started toying around with all types of ideas including this personal site. A project im currently working on is the Star Wars version of PriceLine. I have experience dealing with linux Os, windows (all versions) as well as utilizing terminal and CMD. I like being called by friends and family to come fix something wrong with their computer. I see It and building websites as something fun. Their not jobs if you enjoy them!</p>
